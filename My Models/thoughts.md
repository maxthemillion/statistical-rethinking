# You've (almost) worked through the book. Now what?
While Statistical Rethinking provides a multitude of fancy statistical tools to model a lot of hard problems, a series of important question remains:

> How can I create value with these tools in business situations?

A satisfying answer to this question may hardly be possible in less than 500 lines of text. However applying one of my favorite - and most often missed - principles may guide me towards a solution:

> Focus!

Focus on one or two types of situations that may arise often in business and where Bayesian methods may help to find an answer. Which situations may be candidates:

* What is the probability of a certain (repeated) event? -> Binomial models
* How long will it take until some event occurs? -> Survival analysis


Modelling probabilities could be one of the most common but also most useful cases for risk analysis.
