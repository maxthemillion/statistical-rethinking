# My attempts towards Bayesian modeling
I am currently working through the book ["Statistical Rethinking" by Richard McElreath](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/). In this repository you can find my solutions to some of the end of chapter problems. It also contains my own experiments with the rethinking R-package and Bayesian Data Analysis in general.
